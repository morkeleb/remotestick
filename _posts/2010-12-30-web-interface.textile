There is a web interface add-on available for RemoteStick Server. You will need at least v0.4.0. The add-on "is found here.":https://github.com/morkeleb/remotestick-webgui Click on Downloads link to find the lastest available version of the add-on. Replace the static folder in your remotestick-server directory with the static folder in remotestick-webgui. You should now be able to access the web interface through http://[hostname]:[port]/s/
In the future we might bundle this webgui together with remotestick-server releases but for now you'll have to follow the link above and install it yourself. 

Thanks to "morkeleb":https://github.com/morkeleb for this add-on.

Happy remoting!
